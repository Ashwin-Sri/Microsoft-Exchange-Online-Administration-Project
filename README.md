# Microsoft Exchange Online – Administration & Automation Showcase

This project demonstrates my validated experience with **Microsoft Exchange Online**, reflecting the depth and editorial rigor of an Exchange Online Administrator role. Tasks are executed in a live Microsoft 365 tenant using both the **Exchange Admin Center** and **Exchange Online PowerShell**, with screenshots, annotations, and outcome validation.

The project is divided into two distinct tracks:

- **Portal Tasks** – Manual administration using the Exchange Admin Center (EAC)  
- **PowerShell Tasks** – Scripted automation for scalable mailbox, mail flow, and compliance workflows  

---

## Scope
All tasks are scoped to reflect real-world Exchange Online administration, covering mailbox lifecycle, permissions, distribution groups, mail flow rules, retention, and troubleshooting.  
Portal tasks focus on day-to-day workflows, while PowerShell tasks enable automation, reporting, and enterprise-scale operations.

## Objectives
- Demonstrate hands-on experience with **Exchange Online administration**  
- Showcase **automation and reporting capabilities** with PowerShell  
- Reflect editorial precision in documenting mail flow, compliance, and retention tasks
